# Dithering-with-Pascal-Triangle
In this article, I present a cellular automaton (CA) which evolve according to a set of rules derived from a well known combinatorial structure, the Pascal's Triangle. With only 2 neighbour cells, this probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) produces point sampling commonly observed in high-quality digital dithering and halftoning techniques. 

Feel free to play :)
